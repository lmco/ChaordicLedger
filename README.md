# CharodicLedger
The ChaordicLedger is the implementation of a design for a combination of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and a Distributed File System (DFS) to create a secure, enterprise-grade platform for storing interlinked project artifacts.

The development of this platform is in pursuit of the author's PhD research objectives.

## Design Objectives
1. The platform shall be portable.
    1. All deployment-specific attributes shall be specifiable at deployment time (e.g. from a pipeline)
1. Test automation shall be implemented early and where practical.
1. Free and Open-Source technologies shall be leveraged.
